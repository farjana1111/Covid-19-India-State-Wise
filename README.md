# Covid-19-India-State-Wise

## Introduction
This project contains exploratory data analysis and data visualization of statewise covid-19 data of India. The discussion includes spread of covid-19 cases , deaths, recoveries etc across the nation. I have used geojson for plotting maps to represent statewise data and drawn conclusions based on these plots that helps understand the data better. I had done this project for applying the things I learned during the 'Data Analytics& Exploratory Data Ananlysis with Python'.
# Workflow
1. Importing dependencies and loading the data
2. Renaming the columns and creating new ones
3. Checking for null and duplicate values
4. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization
